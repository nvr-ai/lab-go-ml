# Images Kernels Stream Processing


### [`TestVideoStreamProcessing`](../images/kernels/integration_test.go)

This test coverage shows the frame budget, tolerance settings, and exact timing that causes frames to be dropped.

## Analysis

1. **YOLO_HD_30fps**: 3 frames dropped (5.08%)
   - Frame 1: 39.551ms processing > **33ms+3.3ms** budget (exceeded by **3.251ms**)
   - Frame 16: 77.492ms processing > **33ms+3.3ms** budget (exceeded by **41.192ms**)
   - Frame 17: 36.613ms processing > **33ms+3.3ms** budget (exceeded by **312Âµs**)

2. **DFINE_FHD_30fps**: 1 frame dropped (1.67%)
   - Frame 21: 56.227ms processing > **33ms+3.3ms** budget (exceeded by **19.927ms**)

3. **FasterRCNN_HD_15fps**: 0 frames dropped (0.00%) 
   - All frames processed within **66.7ms** budget (15fps target)

4. **RTDETR_HD_30fps**: 0 frames dropped (0.00%) 
   - All frames processed within **33ms+3.3ms** budget (30fps target)

**Performance Analysis:**
- Frame drops occur when processing exceeds the **33ms budget + 10% tolerance (3.3ms)** 
- YOLO shows highest variability with severe spikes (**77.5ms peak**)
- DFINE has moderate spikes but better consistency
- FasterRCNN benefits from relaxed 15fps timing requirements
- RTDETR demonstrates most consistent performance within budget (**30fps target**)  
- Memory pressure correlates with frame drops: YOLO (1349MB, 119 GC) vs RTDETR (1392MB, 122 GC)
