# QA Checklist

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Benchmark on target hardware (document specific CPU/GPU models).
- [ ] Sustained load testing (24+ hours at target FPS).
- [ ] Memory leak detection (validate pool cleanup).
- [ ] GC pause measurement under load.
- [ ] Concurrent stream capacity testing.

## Accuracy Validation

- [ ] Detection accuracy on standard datasets (COCO, Pascal VOC).
- [ ] A/B testing against baseline (no-blur) performance.
- [ ] Small object detection preservation (objects <32px).
- [ ] Edge case testing (extreme blur radii, unusual dimensions).
- [ ] Model-specific accuracy regression testing.

## Integration Testing

- [ ] End-to-end pipeline validation with ONNX runtime.
- [ ] Multi-stream processing stability.
- [ ] Resource utilization under peak load.
- [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation.
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting integration.

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Performance characteristics for operations team.
- [ ] Configuration parameters and their impacts.
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues.
- [ ] Rollback procedures if issues arise.
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards for ongoing health.
